Programming Language and Compiler
CS5363, Spring '23
=================================================

This program is the Phase II of building Decaf 22 programming language.
This program is the extension of the Scanner project (Phase I) and it now handles the syntax 
analysis phase,the second task of the front-end.The parser will read Decaf source programs and construct an
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). If no syntax errors are found, your compiler will print the completed
AST at the end of parsing.

Development Environment:
========================
Linux OS (via fox server UTSA)

Project Execution Steps:
=======================

Scripting file may need permission to run

  Grant permission by:
  
   ~ cd <workdirfolderpath>
   ~ chmod 777 build.sh OR chmod +x build.sh
   ~ chmod 777 exec.sh  OR chmod +x exec.sh


Building the Project:
====================
  ~ ./build.sh
  
  [NOTE: BUILD SUCCESSFUL!! on the console means the program compiled without any error!!
         BUILD FAILED!! on the console means the program couldnot be compiled duee to some errors]
  The program should compile successfully to execute the output.
  
  Once program is "BUILD SUCCESSFUL"ly, we need to execute to get the output.

Executing the Project:
=====================
To execute in source code file:
  ~ ./exec.sh <inputfilepath>

To write to standard output stream
  ~ ./exec.sh <inputfilepath> > <outputpath>

[examples: ./exec.sh /home/qkp232/Phase2_qkp232/samples/bad1.decaf >/home/qkp232/Phase2_qkp232/output.txt]


Here,

<filepath> refers to the path of input file that you would like to scan.
I have included the samples folder that has number of test input files.

<outputpath> refers to the path where you would like to store your 
completed output after parsing or the expected output in textual format.
In the example above, the output is stored in /home/qkp232/Phase2_qkp232/ 
directory with the filename as "output.txt"
